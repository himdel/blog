# claws-mail trayicon patch

(tags: claws, linux, mail, patch, sylpheed, trayicon)


My mailer is claws-mail (formerly known as sylpheed-claws, a fork of sylpheed) and I love it.
But there's one thing I miss: I can't make the trayicon plugin count only messages in the folders I want instead of all folders. (So it'd tell me about new messages in inbox + important but not in newsgroups and spam.)

Well, here's a quick and dirty proto patch for 2.10.0. The folder names are hardcoded into trayicon.c and necesary changes were made to folder.c . It works for me but of course I should pass a list of folders including paths instead of just a string like "folder1 folder2 ...folderN" and there should be a way to change the folders in the GUI. I'll do it later.

EDIT: As of claws-3.something, vanilla claws has this option in the menu, so the patch is no longer needed.
