# Missing tools

(tags: draft, blame, git, programming, rebase)


<p dir="ltr">
I'm missing three tools in my life... </p>
<p dir="ltr">
1. Recursive git blame 
1. Rebase tracker (including diffing a commit from its previous version) 
1. Static analysis based object tracker (where does this value come from? Which properties are actually used when passed to this function?...) </p>
